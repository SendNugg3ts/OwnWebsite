          Hi, my name is Lu√≠s Silva and I am currently taking my master degree
          in Math and Computer Science. I am passionate about Computers and
          Programming in general and enjoy videogames since I was born,
          basically. In my free time, I like to play video games and make fun
          projects just like this website. Thank you for visiting my website!
